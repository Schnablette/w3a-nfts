### How the v0.0.0 Works
- v1.0.0  the first number represents how many times we merge into main branch.
- v0.1.0  the second number represents how many times we push or merge into dev branch.
- v0.0.1  the third number is each of our feature branch we will work out of to create each component before merging it into the dev branch.
